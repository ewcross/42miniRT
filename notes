to do:

	- check resolution resizing if scene size is greater than display size
	- test everything in the VM - try without libmlx and x11 in directory - should work
	- see if window size function works

to show in correction:

	- basic shapes
	- shadows
	- intersects
	- inside sphere
	- inside cylinder
	- multiple cameras - different directions and switching between
